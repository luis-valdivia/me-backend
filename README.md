## Deployment

Strapi gives you many possible deployment options for your project. Find the one that suits you on the [deployment section of the documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment.html).

I have 2 possible deployment options:

1. Put up on Render with a paid account to use Disk storage.
2. Run locally and use a Nuxt static page.
